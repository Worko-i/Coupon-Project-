# Coupon System Project

A coupon management system allows companies to create coupons as part of their promotional and marketing campaigns. The system also has registered customers.
Customers can purchase coupons, which are limited in quantity and have an expiration date.
Each customer is limited to one coupon per type. The system records the coupons purchased by each customer. 
The system's revenue comes from the sale of coupons to customers and the creation and updating of new coupons by the companies.
The login/authentication process is role-based, with three possible roles: admin, company, or customer.
